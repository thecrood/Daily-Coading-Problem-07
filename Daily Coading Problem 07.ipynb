    "This looks like a problem that is ripe for solving with recursion. First, let's try to think of a recurrence we can use for this problem. We can try some cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"3\" should return 1, since we can parse it only as \"c\".\n",
    "\"\", the empty string and our base case, should return 1.\n",
    "So what if you've been given more complex inputs for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's decode \"12345\" from left to right sequentially. Immediately we understand that they exist two choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decode the first digit \"1\" and then the remaining string \"2345\" or\n",
    "Decode the first two digits \"12\" and then the remaining string \"345\"\n",
    "So decode(\"12345\") is equivalent of decoding decode(\"2345\")+decode(\"345\").So,\n",
    "\n",
    "decode(\"12345\") = decode(\"2345\") + decode(\"345\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words,  the number of ways of decoding the message \"12345\" is equal to the sum of the number of ways we can decode \"2345\" and the number of ways we can decode \"345\".\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when decoding \"27345\" using the same methodology we notice a different behaviour:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decode the first digit \"2\" and then the remaining string \"7345\" or\n",
    "Decode the first two digits \"27\" and.. but wait a minute this is not possible as the last letter z maps to 26.\n",
    "Thus, the number of ways of decoding the message \"27345\" is equal only to the sum of the number of ways we can decode \"7345\".\n",
    "\n",
    "decode(\"27345\") = decode(\"7345\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, decoding \"011\" should return 0, since no letter starts with 0 in our mapping.  \"602\" should also return 0 for similar reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a good starting point. We can see that the recursive structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "If string starts with zero, then there's no valid encoding.\n",
    "If the string's length is less than or equal to 1, there is only 1 encoding.\n",
    "If the first two digits form a number k that is less than or equal to 26, we can recursively count the number of encodings assuming we pick k as a letter.\n",
    "We can also pick the first digit as a letter and count the number of encodings with this assumption."
